In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, ahabit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made methe victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick todetect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normalperson, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused ofbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I havefeigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized bysome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering onthe horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at leastthe terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic andmarred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter ofinfinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if Iforget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishlyrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled outunequally at birth.And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admissionthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or thewet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s foundedon. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wantedthe world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; Iwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into thehuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, wasexempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which Ihave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series ofsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, someheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were relatedto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes tenthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with thatflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, aromantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person andwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned outall right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dustfloated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out myinterest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.------------------------------------------------------------------------My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this MiddleWestern city for three generations. The Carraways are something of aclan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes ofBuccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’sbrother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the CivilWar, and started the wholesale hardware business that my fathercarries on today.I never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—withspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs infather’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter ofa century after my father, and a little later I participated in thatdelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed thecounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of beingthe warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like theragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bondbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed itcould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked itover as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,“Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to financeme for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, Ithought, in the spring of twenty-two.The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warmseason, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendlytrees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take ahouse together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. Hefound the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty amonth, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, andI went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for afew days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, whomade my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom toherself over the electric stove.It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, morerecently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me thefreedom of the neighbourhood.And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on thetrees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiarconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health tobe pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozenvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and theystood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan andMaecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many otherbooks besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote aseries of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and nowI was going to bring back all such things into my life and becomeagain that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.”This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked atfrom a single window, after all.It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one ofthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slenderriotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and wherethere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations ofland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical incontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the mostdomesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the greatwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like theegg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contactend—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetualwonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a moreinteresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particularexcept shape and size.I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, thoughthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a littlesinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of theegg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two hugeplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one onmy right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factualimitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on oneside, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marbleswimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It wasGatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was amansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was aneyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so Ihad a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, andthe consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars amonth.Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Eggglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really beginson the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the TomBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tomin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them inChicago.Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one ofthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—anational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acutelimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours ofanticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college hisfreedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicagoand come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: forinstance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from LakeForest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation waswealthy enough to do that.Why they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France forno particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfullywherever people played polo and were rich together. This was apermanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believeit—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drifton forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence ofsome irrecoverable football game.And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to EastEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their housewas even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-whiteGeorgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started atthe beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally whenit reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as thoughfrom the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of Frenchwindows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warmwindy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing withhis legs apart on the front porch.He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdystraw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and asupercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had establisheddominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaningaggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his ridingclothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fillthose glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you couldsee a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under histhin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression offractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt init, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven whohad hated his guts.“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed tosay, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” Wewere in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate Ialways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to likehim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing aboutrestlessly.Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along thefront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a halfacre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumpedthe tide offshore.“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,politely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. Thewindows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outsidethat seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew throughthe room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like paleflags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of theceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadowon it as wind does on the sea.The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormouscouch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon ananchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses wererippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after ashort flight around the house. I must have stood for a few momentslistening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of apicture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut therear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and thecurtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to thefloor.The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended fulllength at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with herchin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it whichwas quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyesshe gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuringan apology for having disturbed her by coming in.The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightlyforward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into theroom.“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held myhand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there wasno one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way shehad. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl wasBaker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make peoplelean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no lesscharming.)At any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almostimperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the objectshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given hersomething of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunnedtribute from me.I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up anddown, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never beplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitementin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:a singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she haddone gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,exciting things hovering in the next hour.I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheelpainted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail allnight along the north shore.”“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she addedirrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”“I’d like to.”“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”“Never.”“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stoppedand rested his hand on my shoulder.“What you doing, Nick?”“I’m a bond man.”“Who with?”I told him.“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.This annoyed me.“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing atDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for somethingmore. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness thatI started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into theroom. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawnedand with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as longas I can remember.”“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you toNew York all afternoon.”“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from thepantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”Her host looked at her incredulously.“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottomof a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” Ienjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, withan erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backwardat the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes lookedback at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or apicture of her, somewhere before.“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebodythere.”“I don’t know a single—”“You must know Gatsby.”“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelledme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the twoyoung women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open towardthe sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in thediminished wind.“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with herfingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” Shelooked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest dayof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day inthe year and then miss it.”“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at thetable as if she were getting into bed.“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to mehelplessly: “What do people plan?”Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on herlittle finger.“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to,but you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, agreat, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even inkidding.”“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with abantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as coolas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of alldesire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only apolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knewthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening toowould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from theWest, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards itsclose, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheernervous dread of the moment itself.“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glassof corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops orsomething?”I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up inan unexpected way.“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’vegotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Riseof the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea isif we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterlysubmerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression ofunthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words inthem. What was that word we—”“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at herimpatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up tous, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races willhave control of things.”“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociouslytoward the fervent sun.“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tominterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with aslight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all thethings that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and allthat. Do you see?”There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if hiscomplacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butlerleft the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leanedtowards me.“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.“It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’snose?”“That’s why I came over tonight.”“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisherfor some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundredpeople. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally itbegan to affect his nose—”“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give uphis position.”For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon herglowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as Ilistened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingeringregret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word wentinside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leanedforward again, her voice glowing and singing.“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, anabsolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:“An absolute rose?”This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was onlyextemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heartwas trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table andexcused herself and went into the house.Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid ofmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in theroom beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying tohear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.“I thought everybody knew.”“I don’t.”“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.Miss Baker nodded.“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.Don’t you think?”Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of adress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back atthe table.“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, andcontinued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romanticoutdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be anightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singingaway—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s lightenough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her headdecisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutesat table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and Iwas conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet toavoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, butI doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certainhardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrillmetallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situationmight have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephoneimmediately for the police.The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and MissBaker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back intothe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followedDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. Inits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, andher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw thatturbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would besome sedative questions about her little girl.“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Evenif we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”“I wasn’t back from the war.”“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,and I’m pretty cynical about everything.”Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more,and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of herdaughter.“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell youwhat I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”“Very much.”“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she wasless than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out ofthe ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse rightaway if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so Iturned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s agirl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can bein this world, a beautiful little fool.’“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in aconvinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And Iknow. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.”Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, andshe laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’msophisticated!”The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, mybelief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made meuneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort toexact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in amoment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, asif she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secretsociety to which she and Tom belonged.------------------------------------------------------------------------Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat ateither end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from theSaturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, runningtogether in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots anddull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper asshe turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “inour very next issue.”Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and shestood up.“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on theceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,“over at Westchester.”“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuousexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of thesporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heardsome story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was Ihad forgotten long ago.“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”“If you’ll get up.”“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange amarriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling youtogether. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and pushyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard aword.”“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to lether run around the country this way.”“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.“Her family.”“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’sgoing to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lotsof weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will bevery good for her.”Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Ourbeautiful white—”“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”demanded Tom suddenly.“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think wetalked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of creptup on us and first thing you know—”“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minuteslater I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stoodside by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motorDaisy peremptorily called: “Wait!“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you wereengaged to a girl out West.”“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you wereengaged.”“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up againin a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must betrue.”Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t evenvaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was oneof the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an oldfriend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intentionof being rumoured into marriage.Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotelyrich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I droveaway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush outof the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no suchintentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some womanin New York” was really less surprising than that he had beendepressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge ofstale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished hisperemptory heart.Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of waysidegarages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, andwhen I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed andsat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind hadblown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in thetrees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earthblew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat waveredacross the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that Iwas not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow ofmy neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pocketsregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurelymovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggestedthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share washis of our local heavens.I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, andthat would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for hegave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretchedout his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I wasfrom him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glancedseaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minuteand far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I lookedonce more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in theunquiet darkness.                                  IIAbout halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastilyjoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so asto shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valleyof ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges andhills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses andchimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, ofash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powderyair. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,gives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately theash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrablecloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which driftendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue andgigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which passover a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist setthem there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and thensank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and movedaway. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sunand rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers onwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half anhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it wasbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. Hisacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular caféswith her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting withwhomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desireto meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train oneafternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feetand, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determinationto have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumptionwas that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walkedback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’spersistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block ofyellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compactMain Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was anall-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was agarage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followedTom inside.The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was thedust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It hadoccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and thatsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when theproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his handson a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, andfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into hislight blue eyes.“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on theshoulder. “How’s business?”“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are yougoing to sell me that car?”“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it,maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant—”His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickishfigure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She wasin the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her fleshsensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of darkblue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but therewas an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves ofher body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walkingthrough her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and withoutturning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the littleoffice, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. Awhite ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiledeverything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”“All right.”“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged withtwo chairs from his office door.We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few daysbefore the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child wassetting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with DoctorEckleburg.“Awful.”“It does her good to get away.”“Doesn’t her husband object?”“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s sodumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or notquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tomdeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who mightbe on the train.She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretchedtight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform inNew York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and amoving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold creamand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing driveshe let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out fromthe mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately sheturned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on thefront glass.“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to getone for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to JohnD. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen veryrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to thetaxi-window.“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you gotthat kind?”The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand anddrew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointmentin his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over thebrown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dogthat’ll never bother you with catching cold.”“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much isit?”“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you tendollars.”The Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in itsomewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands andsettled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled theweatherproof coat with rapture.“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buyten more dogs with it.”We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on thesummer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a greatflock of white sheep turn the corner.“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if youdon’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s saidto be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”“Well, I’d like to, but—”We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake ofapartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around theneighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her otherpurchases, and went haughtily in.“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose inthe elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”The apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a smalldining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowdedto the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large forit, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes ofladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was anover-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into abonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into theroom. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together witha copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazinesof Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctantelevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which headded on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one ofwhich decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk allafternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a lockedbureau door.I have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was thatafternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerfulsun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on thetelephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy someat the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had bothdisappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read achapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or thewhisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I calledeach other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arriveat the apartment door.The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milkywhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a morerakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of theold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved aboutthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery braceletsjingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietaryhaste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that Iwondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughedimmoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with agirl friend at a hotel.Mr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had justshaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and hewas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. Heinformed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered laterthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement ofMrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. Hiswife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me withpride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seventimes since they had been married.Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was nowattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. Withthe influence of the dress her personality had also undergone achange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garagewas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, herassertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as sheexpanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to berevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most ofthese fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. Ihad a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave methe bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their ownhomes.”“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimeswhen I don’t care what I look like.”“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs.McKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he couldmake something of it.”We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hairfrom over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr.McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then movedhis hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like tobring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold ofall the back hair.”“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I thinkit’s—”Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again,whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice andmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despairat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have tokeep after them all the time.”She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over tothe dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implyingthat a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.“I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,” asserted Mr. McKee.Tom looked at him blankly.“Two of them we have framed downstairs.”“Two what?” demanded Tom.“Two studies. One of them I call Montauk Point—The Gulls, and theother I call Montauk Point—The Sea.”The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.“Do you live down on Long Island, too?” she inquired.“I live at West Egg.”“Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man namedGatsby’s. Do you know him?”“I live next door to him.”“Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm’s. That’swhere all his money comes from.”“Really?”She nodded.“I’m scared of him. I’d hate to have him get anything on me.”This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs.McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, butMr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.“I’d like to do more work on Long Island, if I could get the entry.All I ask is that they should give me a start.”“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter asMrs. Wilson entered with a tray. “She’ll give you a letter ofintroduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”“Do what?” she asked, startled.“You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he cando some studies of him.” His lips moved silently for a moment as heinvented, “ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something likethat.”Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear:“Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.”“Can’t they?”“Can’t stand them.” She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. “What I sayis, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them? If I was themI’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”“Doesn’t she like Wilson either?”The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle, who hadoverheard the question, and it was violent and obscene.“You see,” cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again.“It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart. She’s a Catholic, andthey don’t believe in divorce.”Daisy was not a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at theelaborateness of the lie.“When they do get married,” continued Catherine, “they’re going Westto live for a while until it blows over.”“It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.”“Oh, do you like Europe?” she exclaimed surprisingly. “I just got backfrom Monte Carlo.”“Really.”“Just last year. I went over there with another girl.”“Stay long?”“No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way ofMarseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but wegot gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had anawful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!”The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like theblue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKeecalled me back into the room.“I almost made a mistake, too,” she declared vigorously. “I almostmarried a little kike who’d been after me for years. I knew he wasbelow me. Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way belowyou!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”“Yes, but listen,” said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down,“at least you didn’t marry him.”“I know I didn’t.”“Well, I married him,” said Myrtle, ambiguously. “And that’s thedifference between your case and mine.”“Why did you, Myrtle?” demanded Catherine. “Nobody forced you to.”Myrtle considered.“I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,” she saidfinally. “I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’tfit to lick my shoe.”“You were crazy about him for a while,” said Catherine.“Crazy about him!” cried Myrtle incredulously. “Who said I was crazyabout him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about thatman there.”She pointed suddenly at me, and everyone looked at me accusingly. Itried to show by my expression that I expected no affection.“The only crazy I was was when I married him. I knew right away I madea mistake. He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in, andnever even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when hewas out: ‘Oh, is that your suit?’ I said. ‘This is the first I everheard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried tobeat the band all afternoon.”“She really ought to get away from him,” resumed Catherine to me.“They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom’s thefirst sweetie she ever had.”The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by allpresent, excepting Catherine, who “felt just as good on nothing atall.” Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebratedsandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted toget out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, stridentargument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yethigh over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributedtheir share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkeningstreets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within andwithout, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustiblevariety of life.Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breathpoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always thelast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see mysister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leathershoes, and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him, but every time he lookedat me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over hishead. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his whiteshirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to calla policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got intoa taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subwaytrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t liveforever; you can’t live forever.’ ”She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificiallaughter.“My dear,” she cried, “I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’mthrough with it. I’ve got to get another one tomorrow. I’m going tomake a list of all the things I’ve got to get. A massage and a wave,and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays whereyou touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’sgrave that’ll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won’tforget all the things I got to do.”It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watchand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fistsclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking outmy handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather thathad worried me all the afternoon.The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyesthrough the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. Peopledisappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then losteach other, searched for each other, found each other a few feetaway. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stoodface to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilsonhad any right to mention Daisy’s name.“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson. “I’ll say it whenever Iwant to! Daisy! Dai—”Making a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with hisopen hand.Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’svoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail ofpain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward thedoor. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at thescene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbledhere and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, andthe despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying tospread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes ofVersailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.Taking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.“Come to lunch some day,” he suggested, as we groaned down in theelevator.“Where?”“Anywhere.”“Keep your hands off the lever,” snapped the elevator boy.“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. McKee with dignity, “I didn’t know I wastouching it.”“All right,” I agreed, “I’ll be glad to.”… I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between thesheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.“Beauty and the Beast … Loneliness … Old Grocery Horse … Brook’nBridge …”Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of thePennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting forthe four o’clock train.                                 IIIThere was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights.In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among thewhisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in theafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, ortaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboatsslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts offoam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing partiesto and from the city between nine in the morning and long pastmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug tomeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extragardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammersand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from afruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons lefthis back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine inthe kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges inhalf an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by abutler’s thumb.At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with severalhundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmastree of Gatsby’s enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished withglistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads ofharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a darkgold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, andstocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten thatmost of his female guests were too young to know one from another.By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols andcornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers havecome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars fromNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls andsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed instrange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar isin full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the gardenoutside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casualinnuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiasticmeetings between women who never knew each other’s names.The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, andnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera ofvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groupschange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in thesame breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weavehere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour underthe constantly changing light.Suddenly one of these gypsies, in trembling opal, seizes a cocktailout of the air, dumps it down for courage and, moving her hands likeFrisco, dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; theorchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her, and there is aburst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is GildaGray’s understudy from the Follies. The party has begun.I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was oneof the few guests who had actually been invited. People were notinvited—they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them outto Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door. Once therethey were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby, and after that theyconducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associatedwith an amusement park. Sometimes they came and went without havingmet Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart thatwas its own ticket of admission.I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-eggblue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisinglyformal note from his employer: the honour would be entirely Gatsby’s,it said, if I would attend his “little party” that night. He had seenme several times, and had intended to call on me long before, but apeculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed JayGatsby, in a majestic hand.Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little afterseven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddiesof people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticedon the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number ofyoung Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a littlehungry, and all talking in low, earnest voices to solid and prosperousAmericans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds orinsurance or automobiles. They were at least agonizingly aware of theeasy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a fewwords in the right key.As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host, but the two orthree people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such anamazed way, and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements,that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only placein the garden where a single man could linger without lookingpurposeless and alone.I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment whenJordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marblesteps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuousinterest down into the garden.Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someonebefore I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.“Hello!” I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturallyloud across the garden.“I thought you might be here,” she responded absently as I came up.“I remembered you lived next door to—”She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of mein a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, whostopped at the foot of the steps.“Hello!” they cried together. “Sorry you didn’t win.”That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the weekbefore.“You don’t know who we are,” said one of the girls in yellow, “but wemet you here about a month ago.”“You’ve dyed your hair since then,” remarked Jordan, and I started,but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed tothe premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of acaterer’s basket. With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine, wedescended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray ofcocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at atable with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introducedto us as Mr. Mumble.“Do you come to these parties often?” inquired Jordan of the girlbeside her.“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in analert confident voice. She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it foryou, Lucille?”It was for Lucille, too.“I like to come,” Lucille said. “I never care what I do, so I alwayshave a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, andhe asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package fromCroirier’s with a new evening gown in it.”“Did you keep it?” asked Jordan.“Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in thebust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Twohundred and sixty-five dollars.”“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,”said the other girl eagerly. “He doesn’t want any trouble withanybody.”“Who doesn’t?” I inquired.“Gatsby. Somebody told me—”The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward andlistened eagerly.“I don’t think it’s so much that,” argued Lucille sceptically; “It’smore that he was a German spy during the war.”One of the men nodded in confirmation.“I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him inGermany,” he assured us positively.“Oh, no,” said the first girl, “it couldn’t be that, because he was inthe American army during the war.” As our credulity switched back toher she leaned forward with enthusiasm. “You look at him sometimeswhen he thinks nobody’s looking at him. I’ll bet he killed a man.”She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turnedand looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romanticspeculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from thosewho had found little that it was necessary to whisper about in thisworld.The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was nowbeing served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party, who werespread around a table on the other side of the garden. There werethree married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduategiven to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression thatsooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to agreater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling, this party hadpreserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the functionof representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Eggcondescending to West Egg and carefully on guard against itsspectroscopic gaiety.“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful andinappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: Ihad never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. Theundergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded, but Gatsby was notthere. She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’ton the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, andwalked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak,and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.A stout, middle-aged man, with enormous owl-eyed spectacles, wassitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring withunsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered hewheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.“What do you think?” he demanded impetuously.“About what?”He waved his hand toward the bookshelves.“About that. As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain. Iascertained. They’re real.”“The books?”He nodded.“Absolutely real—have pages and everything. I thought they’d be a nicedurable cardboard. Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.  Pagesand—Here! Lemme show you.”Taking our scepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases andreturned with Volume One of the Stoddard Lectures.“See!” he cried triumphantly. “It’s a bona-fide piece of printedmatter. It fooled me. This fella’s a regular Belasco. It’s atriumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop,too—didn’t cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?”He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf,muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liableto collapse.“Who brought you?” he demanded. “Or did you just come? I was brought.Most people were brought.”Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully, without answering.“I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,” he continued. “Mrs. ClaudRoosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I’ve beendrunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sitin a library.”“Has it?”“A little bit, I think. I can’t tell yet. I’ve only been here an hour.Did I tell you about the books? They’re real. They’re—”“You told us.”We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushingyoung girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couplesholding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in thecorners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually orrelieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or thetraps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor hadsung in Italian, and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz, andbetween the numbers people were doing “stunts” all over the garden,while happy, vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. Apair of stage twins, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, did ababy act in costume, and champagne was served in glasses bigger thanfinger-bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound wasa triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinnydrip of the banjoes on the lawn.I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a manof about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon theslightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoyingmyself now. I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scenehad changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, andprofound.At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.“Your face is familiar,” he said politely. “Weren’t you in the FirstDivision during the war?”“Why yes. I was in the Twenty-eighth Infantry.”“I was in the Sixteenth until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I’d seenyou somewhere before.”We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had justbought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.“Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound.”“What time?”“Any time that suits you best.”It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan lookedaround and smiled.“Having a gay time now?” she inquired.“Much better.” I turned again to my new acquaintance. “This is anunusual party for me. I haven’t even seen the host. I live overthere—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “andthis man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.“I’m Gatsby,” he said suddenly.“What!” I exclaimed. “Oh, I beg your pardon.”“I thought you knew, old sport. I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.”He smiled understandingly—much more than understandingly. It was oneof those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, thatyou may come across four or five times in life. It faced—or seemed toface—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated onyou with an irresistible prejudice in your favour. It understood youjust so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as youwould like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it hadprecisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped toconvey. Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at anelegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborateformality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before heintroduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking hiswords with care.Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butlerhurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling himon the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each ofus in turn.“If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,” he urged me.“Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.”When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assureher of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a floridand corpulent person in his middle years.“Who is he?” I demanded. “Do you know?”“He’s just a man named Gatsby.”“Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?”“Now you’re started on the subject,” she answered with a wan smile.“Well, he told me once he was an Oxford man.”A dim background started to take shape behind him, but at her nextremark it faded away.“However, I don’t believe it.”“Why not?”“I don’t know,” she insisted, “I just don’t think he went there.”Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think hekilled a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I wouldhave accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang fromthe swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. Thatwas comprehensible. But young men didn’t—at least in my provincialinexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere andbuy a palace on Long Island Sound.“Anyhow, he gives large parties,” said Jordan, changing the subjectwith an urban distaste for the concrete. “And I like large parties.They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestraleader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.“Ladies and gentlemen,” he cried. “At the request of Mr. Gatsby we aregoing to play for you Mr. Vladmir Tostoff’s latest work, whichattracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read thepapers you know there was a big sensation.” He smiled with jovialcondescension, and added: “Some sensation!” Whereupon everybodylaughed.“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’sJazz History of the World!’ ”The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as itbegan my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps andlooking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skinwas drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked asthough it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister abouthim. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set himoff from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct asthe fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the World”was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in apuppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully intomen’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest theirfalls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touchedGatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’shead for one link.“I beg your pardon.”Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.“Miss Baker?” he inquired. “I beg your pardon, but Mr. Gatsby wouldlike to speak to you alone.”“With me?” she exclaimed in surprise.“Yes, madame.”She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, andfollowed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore herevening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was ajauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walkupon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused andintriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room whichoverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate, who was nowengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and whoimplored me to join him, I went inside.The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow wasplaying the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young ladyfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity ofchampagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,that everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she wasweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it withgasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quaveringsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, forwhen they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes theyassumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slowblack rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the noteson her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, andwent off into a deep vinous sleep.“She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,” explained agirl at my elbow.I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fightswith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan’s party, the quartetfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men wastalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, afterattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferentway, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervalsshe appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:“You promised!” into his ear.The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hallwas at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highlyindignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other inslightly raised voices.“Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.”“Never heard anything so selfish in my life.”“We’re always the first ones to leave.”“So are we.”“Well, we’re almost the last tonight,” said one of the men sheepishly.“The orchestra left half an hour ago.”In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyondcredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wiveswere lifted, kicking, into the night.As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened andJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some lastword to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly intoformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but shelingered for a moment to shake hands.“I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,” she whispered. “How longwere we in there?”“Why, about an hour.”“It was … simply amazing,” she repeated abstractedly. “But I swore Iwouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefullyin my face. “Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name ofMrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …” She was hurrying off as shetalked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into herparty at the door.Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, Ijoined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him. Iwanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and toapologize for not having known him in the garden.“Don’t mention it,” he enjoined me eagerly. “Don’t give it anotherthought, old sport.” The familiar expression held no more familiaritythan the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. “And don’tforget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning, at nineo’clock.”Then the butler, behind his shoulder:“Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.”“All right, in a minute. Tell them I’ll be right there … Good night.”“Good night.”“Good night.” He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasantsignificance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desiredit all the time. “Good night, old sport … Good night.”But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quiteover. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated abizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right sideup, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which hadleft Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wallaccounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now gettingconsiderable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,as they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant dinfrom those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added tothe already violent confusion of the scene.A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood inthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from thetyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.“See!” he explained. “It went in the ditch.”The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first theunusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron ofGatsby’s library.“How’d it happen?”He shrugged his shoulders.“I know nothing whatever about mechanics,” he said decisively.“But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?”“Don’t ask me,” said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the wholematter. “I know very little about driving—next to nothing. Ithappened, and that’s all I know.”“Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.”“But I wasn’t even trying,” he explained indignantly, “I wasn’t eventrying.”An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.“Do you want to commit suicide?”“You’re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!”“You don’t understand,” explained the criminal. “I wasn’t driving.There’s another man in the car.”The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained“Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it wasnow a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had openedwide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, apale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentativelyat the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessantgroaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a momentbefore he perceived the man in the duster.“Wha’s matter?” he inquired calmly. “Did we run outa gas?”“Look!”Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at itfor a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that ithad dropped from the sky.“It came off,” someone explained.He nodded.“At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.”A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,he remarked in a determined voice:“Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?”At least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by anyphysical bond.“Back out,” he suggested after a moment. “Put her in reverse.”“But the wheel’s off!”He hesitated.“No harm in trying,” he said.The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away andcut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of amoon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before,and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the greatdoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, whostood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.------------------------------------------------------------------------Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given theimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart wereall that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual eventsin a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed meinfinitely less than my personal affairs.Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw myshadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New Yorkto the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmenby their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowdedrestaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. Ieven had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City andworked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwingmean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July Ilet it blow quietly away.I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was thegloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library andstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. Therewere generally a few rioters around, but they never came into thelibrary, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night wasmellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women andmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenueand pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a fewminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would everknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to theirapartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned andsmiled back at me before they faded through a door into warmdarkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a hauntingloneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks wholoitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitaryrestaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignantmoments of night and life.Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were linedfive deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, Ifelt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as theywaited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,and lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imaginingthat I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimateexcitement, I wished them well.For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer Ifound her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,because she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then itwas something more. I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort oftender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the worldconcealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what itwas. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left aborrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied aboutit—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded methat night at Daisy’s. At her first big golf tournament there was arow that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had movedher ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approachedthe proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted hisstatement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have beenmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I sawthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergencefrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given thisunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when shewas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned tothe world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing younever blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was onthat same house-party that we had a curious conversation about drivinga car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that ourfender flicked a button on one man’s coat.“You’re a rotten driver,” I protested. “Either you ought to be morecareful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.”“I am careful.”“No, you’re not.”“Well, other people are,” she said lightly.“What’s that got to do with it?”“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “It takes two to make anaccident.”“Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.”“I hope I never will,” she answered. “I hate careless people. That’swhy I like you.”Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she haddeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I lovedher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act asbrakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myselfdefinitely out of that tangle back home. I’d been writing letters oncea week and signing them: “Love, Nick,” and all I could think of washow, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache ofperspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vagueunderstanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, andthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have everknown.                                  IVOn Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore,the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkledhilariously on his lawn.“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere betweenhis cocktails and his flowers. “One time he killed a man who had foundout that he was nephew to Von Hindenburg and second cousin to thedevil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that therecrystal glass.”Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names ofthose who came to Gatsby’s house that summer. It is an old timetablenow, disintegrating at its folds, and headed “This schedule in effectJuly 5th, 1922.” But I can still read the grey names, and they willgive you a better impression than my generalities of those whoaccepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute ofknowing nothing whatever about him.From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and aman named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, whowas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the WillieVoltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in acorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever camenear. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach andMr. Chrystie’s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turnedcotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in thegarden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and theFishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before hewent to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive thatMrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand. The Danciescame, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and MauriceA. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, andBeluga’s girls.From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck andCecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, whocontrolled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and DonS. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with themovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled hiswife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.(“Rot-Gut”) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came togamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he wascleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitablynext day.A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as“the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical peoplethere were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and GeorgeDuckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and theBackhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans andthe Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and theSmirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, whokilled himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quitethe same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one withanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I haveforgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloriaor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious namesof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great Americancapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselvesto be.In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien camethere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who hadhis nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head ofthe American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to beher chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, andwhose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer.------------------------------------------------------------------------At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous carlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melodyfrom its three-noted horn.It was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two ofhis parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,made frequent use of his beach.“Good morning, old sport. You’re having lunch with me today and Ithought we’d ride up together.”He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with thatresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,I suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This qualitywas continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shapeof restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tappingfoot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.He saw me looking with admiration at his car.“It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport?” He jumped off to give me a betterview. “Haven’t you ever seen it before?”I’d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, brightwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length withtriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced witha labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting downbehind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,we started to town.I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month andfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my firstimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, hadgradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of anelaborate roadhouse next door.And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn’t reached West Eggvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinishedand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colouredsuit.“Look here, old sport,” he broke out surprisingly, “what’s youropinion of me, anyhow?”A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which thatquestion deserves.“Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,” he interrupted.“I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories youhear.”So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversationin his halls.“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divineretribution to stand by. “I am the son of some wealthy people in theMiddle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated atOxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for manyyears. It is a family tradition.”He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed hewas lying. He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowedit, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And withthis doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered ifthere wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.“What part of the Middle West?” I inquired casually.“San Francisco.”“I see.”“My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.”His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of aclan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pullingmy leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.“After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals ofEurope—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, huntingbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying toforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.”With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The veryphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except thatof a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursueda tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.“Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried veryhard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted acommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest Itook the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that therewas a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’tadvance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirtymen with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at lastthey found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles ofdead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gaveme a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on theAdriatic Sea!”Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with hissmile. The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history andsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. Itappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which hadelicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart. Myincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimminghastily through a dozen magazines.He reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,fell into my palm.“That’s the one from Montenegro.”To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. “Orderi diDanilo,” ran the circular legend, “Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.”“Turn it.”“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read, “For Valour Extraordinary.”“Here’s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. Itwas taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl ofDoncaster.”It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in anarchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palaceon the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, withtheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.“I’m going to make a big request of you today,” he said, pocketing hissouvenirs with satisfaction, “so I thought you ought to know somethingabout me. I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and theretrying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated.“You’ll hear about it this afternoon.”“At lunch?”“No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you’re taking MissBaker to tea.”“Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?”“No, old sport, I’m not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speakto you about this matter.”I hadn’t the faintest idea what “this matter” was, but I was moreannoyed than interested. I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order todiscuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be somethingutterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot uponhis overpopulated lawn.He wouldn’t say another word. His correctness grew on him as we nearedthe city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse ofred-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined withthe dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds.Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had aglimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with pantingvitality as we went by.With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through halfAstoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevatedI heard the familiar “jug-jug-spat!” of a motorcycle, and a franticpoliceman rode alongside.“All right, old sport,” called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a whitecard from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes.“Right you are,” agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. “Know you nexttime, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!”“What was that?” I inquired. “The picture of Oxford?”“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me aChristmas card every year.”Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making aconstant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up acrossthe river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out ofnonolfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is alwaysthe city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all themystery and the beauty in the world.A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by twocarriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages forfriends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and shortupper lips of southeastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight ofGatsby’s splendid car was included in their sombre holiday. As wecrossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a whitechauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl. Ilaughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us inhaughty rivalry.“Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,” I thought;“anything at all …”Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.------------------------------------------------------------------------Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsbyfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyespicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.”A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with twofine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After amoment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.“—So I took one look at him,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my handearnestly, “and what do you think I did?”“What?” I inquired politely.But evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand andcovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh,don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then andthere.”Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into therestaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he wasstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.“Highballs?” asked the head waiter.“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at thepresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. “But I like across the streetbetter!”“Yes, highballs,” agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: “It’s toohot over there.”“Hot and small—yes,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “but full of memories.”“What place is that?” I asked.“The old Metropole.”“The old Metropole,” brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. “Filled withfaces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can’tforget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. Itwas six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot allevening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with afunny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. ‘Allright,’ says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in hischair.“ ‘Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’tyou, so help me, move outside this room.’“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised theblinds we’d of seen daylight.”“Did he go?” I asked innocently.“Sure he went.” Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me indignantly. “Heturned around in the door and says: ‘Don’t let that waiter take awaymy coffee!’ Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him threetimes in his full belly and drove away.”“Four of them were electrocuted,” I said, remembering.“Five, with Becker.” His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.“I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.”The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answeredfor me:“Oh, no,” he exclaimed, “this isn’t the man.”“No?” Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.“This is just a friend. I told you we’d talk about that some othertime.”“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, “I had a wrong man.”A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the moresentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat withferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all aroundthe room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the peopledirectly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would havetaken one short glance beneath our own table.“Look here, old sport,” said Gatsby, leaning toward me, “I’m afraid Imade you a little angry this morning in the car.”There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.“I don’t like mysteries,” I answered, “and I don’t understand why youwon’t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all gotto come through Miss Baker?”“Oh, it’s nothing underhand,” he assured me. “Miss Baker’s a greatsportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t allright.”Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.“He has to telephone,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with hiseyes. “Fine fellow, isn’t he? Handsome to look at and a perfectgentleman.”“Yes.”“He’s an Oggsford man.”“Oh!”“He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?”“I’ve heard of it.”“It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.”“Have you known Gatsby for a long time?” I inquired.“Several years,” he answered in a gratified way. “I made the pleasureof his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered aman of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said tomyself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduceto your mother and sister.’ ” He paused. “I see you’re looking at mycuff buttons.”I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed ofoddly familiar pieces of ivory.“Finest specimens of human molars,” he informed me.“Well!” I inspected them. “That’s a very interesting idea.”“Yeah.” He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. “Yeah, Gatsby’s verycareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend’swife.”When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table andsat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to hisfeet.“I have enjoyed my lunch,” he said, “and I’m going to run off from youtwo young men before I outstay my welcome.”“Don’t hurry Meyer,” said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiemraised his hand in a sort of benediction.“You’re very polite, but I belong to another generation,” he announcedsolemnly. “You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladiesand your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of hishand. “As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself onyou any longer.”As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. Iwondered if I had said anything to offend him.“He becomes very sentimental sometimes,” explained Gatsby. “This isone of his sentimental days. He’s quite a character around New York—adenizen of Broadway.”“Who is he, anyhow, an actor?”“No.”“A dentist?”“Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he’s a gambler.” Gatsby hesitated, then added,coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”“Fixed the World’s Series?” I repeated.The idea staggered me. I remembered, of course, that the World’sSeries had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all Iwould have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end ofsome inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man couldstart to play with the faith of fifty million people—with thesingle-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.“How did he happen to do that?” I asked after a minute.“He just saw the opportunity.”“Why isn’t he in jail?”“They can’t get him, old sport. He’s a smart man.”I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change Icaught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.“Come along with me for a minute,” I said; “I’ve got to say hello tosomeone.”When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in ourdirection.“Where’ve you been?” he demanded eagerly. “Daisy’s furious because youhaven’t called up.”“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look ofembarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.“How’ve you been, anyhow?” demanded Tom of me. “How’d you happen tocome up this far to eat?”“I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.”I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.------------------------------------------------------------------------One October day in nineteen-seventeen—(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on astraight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalksand half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had onshoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into thesoft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in thewind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners infront of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,in a disapproving way.The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged toDaisy Fay’s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, andby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. Shedressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day longthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from CampTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her thatnight. “Anyways, for an hour!”When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster wasbeside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I hadnever seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that shedidn’t see me until I was five feet away.“Hello, Jordan,” she called unexpectedly. “Please come here.”I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all theolder girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the RedCross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that shecouldn’t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she wasspeaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked atsometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered theincident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn’t lay eyes onhim again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island Ididn’t realize it was the same man.That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beauxmyself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy veryoften. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyoneat all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother hadfound her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and saygoodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectuallyprevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family forseveral weeks. After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers anymore, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,who couldn’t get into the army at all.By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a débutafter the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to aman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. Hecame down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired awhole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding hegave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousanddollars.I was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before thebridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the Junenight in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottleof Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.“ ’Gratulate me,” she muttered. “Never had a drink before, but oh howI do enjoy it.”“What’s the matter, Daisy?”I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before.“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with heron the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. “Take ’em downstairsand give ’em back to whoever they belong to. Tell ’em all Daisy’schange’ her mine. Say: ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’ ”She began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found hermother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.She wouldn’t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with herand squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in thesoap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.But she didn’t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia andput ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and halfan hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were aroundher neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o’clock shemarried Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on athree months’ trip to the South Seas.I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I’dnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for aminute she’d look around uneasily, and say: “Where’s Tom gone?” andwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in thedoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by thehour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him withunfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made youlaugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after Ileft Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him gotinto the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of thechambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France fora year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, andthen they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular inChicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them youngand rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfectreputation. Perhaps because she doesn’t drink. It’s a great advantagenot to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so thateverybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care. Perhaps Daisynever went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voiceof hers …Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the firsttime in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knewGatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room andwoke me up, and said: “What Gatsby?” and when I described him—I washalf asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the manshe used to know. It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsbywith the officer in her white car.------------------------------------------------------------------------When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plazafor half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars inthe West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gatheredlike crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight: “I’m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when you’re asleep Into your tent I’ll creep—”“It was a strange coincidence,” I said.“But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.”“Why not?”“Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.”Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on thatJune night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb ofhis purposeless splendour.“He wants to know,” continued Jordan, “if you’ll invite Daisy to yourhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.”The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years andbought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so thathe could “come over” some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.“Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?”“He’s afraid, he’s waited so long. He thought you might beoffended. You see, he’s regular tough underneath it all.”Something worried me.“Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?”“He wants her to see his house,” she explained. “And your house isright next door.”“Oh!”“I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, somenight,” went on Jordan, “but she never did. Then he began askingpeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. Itwas that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heardthe elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediatelysuggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad:“ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying. ‘Iwant to see her right next door.’“When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started toabandon the whole idea. He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though hesays he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance ofcatching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.”It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my armaround Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked herto dinner. Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universalscepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of myarm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of headyexcitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, andthe tired.”“And Daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured Jordan tome.“Does she want to see Gatsby?”“She’s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn’t want her to know. You’rejust supposed to invite her to tea.”We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-NinthStreet, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied facefloated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew upthe girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouthsmiled, and so I drew her up again closer, this time to my face.                                  VWhen I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment thatmy house was on fire. Two o’clock and the whole corner of thepeninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubberyand made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning acorner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar.At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolveditself into “hide-and-go-seek” or “sardines-in-the-box” with all thehouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn’t a sound. Only wind inthe trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and onagain as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groanedaway I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.“Your place looks like the World’s Fair,” I said.“Does it?” He turned his eyes toward it absently. “I have beenglancing into some of the rooms. Let’s go to Coney Island, oldsport. In my car.”“It’s too late.”“Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven’t madeuse of it all summer.”“I’ve got to go to bed.”“All right.”He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.“I talked with Miss Baker,” I said after a moment. “I’m going to callup Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.”“Oh, that’s all right,” he said carelessly. “I don’t want to put youto any trouble.”“What day would suit you?”“What day would suit you?” he corrected me quickly. “I don’t want toput you to any trouble, you see.”“How about the day after tomorrow?”He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: “I want to get thegrass cut,” he said.We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where myragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. Isuspected that he meant my grass.“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated.“Would you rather put it off for a few days?” I asked.“Oh, it isn’t about that. At least—” He fumbled with a series ofbeginnings. “Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t makemuch money, do you?”“Not very much.”This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on alittle business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. AndI thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds,aren’t you, old sport?”“Trying to.”“Well, this would interest you. It wouldn’t take up much of your timeand you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a ratherconfidential sort of thing.”I realize now that under different circumstances that conversationmight have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offerwas obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had nochoice except to cut him off there.“I’ve got my hands full,” I said. “I’m much obliged but I couldn’ttake on any more work.”“You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.” Evidently hethought that I was shying away from the “gonnegtion” mentioned atlunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to beresponsive, so he went unwillingly home.The evening had made me lightheaded and happy; I think I walked into adeep sleep as I entered my front door. So I don’t know whether or notGatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced intorooms” while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from theoffice next morning, and invited her to come to tea.“Don’t bring Tom,” I warned her.“What?”“Don’t bring Tom.”“Who is ‘Tom’?” she asked innocently.The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o’clock a man in araincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said thatMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that Ihad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West EggVillage to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buysome cups and lemons and flowers.The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrivedfrom Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hourlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannelsuit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale,and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.“Is everything all right?” he asked immediately.“The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.”“What grass?” he inquired blankly. “Oh, the grass in the yard.” Helooked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’tbelieve he saw a thing.“Looks very good,” he remarked vaguely. “One of the papers said theythought the rain would stop about four. I think it was TheJournal. Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?”I took him into the pantry, where he looked a little reproachfully atthe Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from thedelicatessen shop.“Will they do?” I asked.“Of course, of course! They’re fine!” and he added hollowly, “… oldsport.”The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist, through whichoccasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyesthrough a copy of Clay’s Economics, starting at the Finnish tread thatshook the kitchen floor, and peering towards the bleared windows fromtime to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings weretaking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me, in anuncertain voice, that he was going home.“Why’s that?”“Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as ifthere was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. “I can’t waitall day.”“Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.”He sat down miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneouslythere was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumpedup, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up thedrive. It stopped. Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath athree-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstaticsmile.“Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?”The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. Ihad to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my earalone, before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like adash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet withglistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.“Are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did I haveto come alone?”“That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go faraway and spend an hour.”“Come back in an hour, Ferdie.” Then in a grave murmur: “His name isFerdie.”“Does the gasoline affect his nose?”“I don’t think so,” she said innocently. “Why?”We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted.“Well, that’s funny,” I exclaimed.“What’s funny?”She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at thefront door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with hishands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in apuddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into thehall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into theliving-room. It wasn’t a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of myown heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.For half a minute there wasn’t a sound. Then from the living-room Iheard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed byDaisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:“I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.”A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall, so Iwent into the room.Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against themantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even ofboredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the faceof a defunct mantelpiece clock, and from this position his distraughteyes stared down at Daisy, who was sitting, frightened but graceful,on the edge of a stiff chair.“We’ve met before,” muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily atme, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckilythe clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of hishead, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers, andset it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the armof the sofa and his chin in his hand.“I’m sorry about the clock,” he said.My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn’t muster upa single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.“It’s an old clock,” I told them idiotically.I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces onthe floor.“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice asmatter-of-fact as it could ever be.“Five years next November.”The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at leastanother minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperatesuggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniacFinn brought it in on a tray.Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physicaldecency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and,while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the otherof us with tense, unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn’t an end initself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to myfeet.“Where are you going?” demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.“I’ll be back.”“I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.”He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, andwhispered: “Oh, God!” in a miserable way.“What’s the matter?”“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side toside, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”“You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,” and luckily I added: “Daisy’sembarrassed too.”“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously.“Just as much as you are.”“Don’t talk so loud.”“You’re acting like a little boy,” I broke out impatiently. “Not onlythat, but you’re rude. Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.”He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettablereproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the otherroom.I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made hisnervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a hugeblack knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against therain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved byGatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoricmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree exceptGatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his churchsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the “period”craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to payfive years’ taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners wouldhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took theheart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediatedecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still onthe door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, havealways been obstinate about being peasantry.After half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer’s automobilerounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful. A maid began openingthe upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into thegarden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it hadseemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a littlenow and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt thatsilence had fallen within the house too.I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short ofpushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound. Theywere sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as ifsome question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige ofembarrassment was gone. Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and whenI came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchiefbefore a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simplyconfounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture ofexultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the littleroom.“Oh, hello, old sport,” he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years. Ithought for a moment he was going to shake hands.“It’s stopped raining.”“Has it?” When he realized what I was talking about, that there weretwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news toDaisy. “What do you think of that? It’s stopped raining.”“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, toldonly of her unexpected joy.“I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,” he said, “I’d like toshow her around.”“You’re sure you want me to come?”“Absolutely, old sport.”Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought withhumiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.“My house looks well, doesn’t it?” he demanded. “See how the wholefront of it catches the light.”I agreed that it was splendid.“Yes.” His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. “Ittook me just three years to earn the money that bought it.”“I thought you inherited your money.”“I did, old sport,” he said automatically, “but I lost most of it inthe big panic—the panic of the war.”I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him whatbusiness he was in he answered: “That’s my affair,” before he realizedthat it wasn’t an appropriate reply.“Oh, I’ve been in several things,” he corrected himself. “I was in thedrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I’m not ineither one now.” He looked at me with more attention. “Do you meanyou’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?”Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows ofbrass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.“That huge place there?” she cried pointing.“Do you like it?”“I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.”“I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. Peoplewho do interesting things. Celebrated people.”Instead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to theroad and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisyadmired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,admired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothyodour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour ofkiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and findno stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound butbird voices in the trees.And inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms andRestoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behindevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until wehad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton CollegeLibrary” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break intoghostly laughter.We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavendersilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where adishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. Itwas Mr. Klipspringer, the “boarder.” I had seen him wandering hungrilyabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby’s ownapartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam’s study, where we satdown and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard inthe wall.He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revaluedeverything in his house according to the measure of response it drewfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at hispossessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astoundingpresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down aflight of stairs.His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser wasgarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brushwith delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down andshaded his eyes and began to laugh.“It’s the funniest thing, old sport,” he said hilariously. “Ican’t—When I try to—”He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon athird. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumedwith wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so tospeak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,he was running down like an over-wound clock.Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patentcabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, andhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.“I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over aselection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.”He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table inmany-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the softrich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids incoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms ofindian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head intothe shirts and began to cry stormily.“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in thethick folds. “It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—suchbeautiful shirts before.”------------------------------------------------------------------------After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, andthe hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s windowit began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugatedsurface of the Sound.“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,”said Gatsby. “You always have a green light that burns all night atthe end of your dock.”Daisy put her arm through his abruptly, but he seemed absorbed in whathe had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossalsignificance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to thegreat distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed verynear to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star tothe moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count ofenchanted objects had diminished by one.I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objectsin the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachtingcostume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.“Who’s this?”“That? That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.”The name sounded faintly familiar.“He’s dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago.”There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on thebureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparentlywhen he was about eighteen.“I adore it,” exclaimed Daisy. “The pompadour! You never told me youhad a pompadour—or a yacht.”“Look at this,” said Gatsby quickly. “Here’s a lot of clippings—aboutyou.”They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see therubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby took up the receiver.“Yes … Well, I can’t talk now … I can’t talk now, old sport … I said asmall town … He must know what a small town is … Well, he’s no use tous if Detroit is his idea of a small town …”He rang off.“Come here quick!” cried Daisy at the window.The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west,and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like tojust get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push youaround.”I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presencemade them feel more satisfactorily alone.“I know what we’ll do,” said Gatsby, “we’ll have Klipspringer play thepiano.”He went out of the room calling “Ewing!” and returned in a few minutesaccompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, withshell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair. He was now decentlyclothed in a “sport shirt,” open at the neck, sneakers, and ducktrousers of a nebulous hue.“Did we interrupt your exercise?” inquired Daisy politely.“I was asleep,” cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.“That is, I’d been asleep. Then I got up …”“Klipspringer plays the piano,” said Gatsby, cutting him off. “Don’tyou, Ewing, old sport?”“I don’t play well. I don’t—hardly play at all. I’m all out of prac—”“We’ll go downstairs,” interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. Thegrey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.In the music-room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with heron a couch far across the room, where there was no light save what thegleaming floor bounced in from the hall.When Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on thebench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.“I’m all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn’t play. I’m allout of prac—”“Don’t talk so much, old sport,” commanded Gatsby. “Play!” “In the morning, In the evening, Ain’t we got fun—”Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder alongthe Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electrictrains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from NewYork. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement wasgenerating on the air. “One thing’s sure and nothing’s surer The rich get richer and the poor get—children. In the meantime, In between time—”As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression ofbewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubthad occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almostfive years! There must have been moments even that afternoon whenDaisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, butbecause of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyondher, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creativepassion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every brightfeather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness canchallenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand tookhold of hers, and as she said something low in his ear he turnedtoward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most,with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t beover-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand;Gatsby didn’t know me now at all. I looked once more at them and theylooked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I wentout of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving themthere together.                                  VIAbout this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived onemorning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.“Anything to say about what?” inquired Gatsby politely.“Why—any statement to give out.”It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heardGatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he eitherwouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand. This was his day off andwith laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right.Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted hishospitality and so become authorities upon his past, had increased allsummer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legendssuch as the “underground pipeline to Canada” attached themselves tohim, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a houseat all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretlyup and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were asource of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy tosay.James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He hadchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment thatwitnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yachtdrop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It wasJames Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in atorn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already JayGatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, andinformed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half anhour.I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then. Hisparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imaginationhad never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth wasthat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonicconception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it meansanything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s business,the service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he inventedjust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would belikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore ofLake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any othercapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening bodylived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracingdays. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he becamecontemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, ofthe others because they were hysterical about things which in hisoverwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesqueand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe ofineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clockticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangledclothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of hisfancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with anoblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet forhis imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality ofreality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely ona fairy’s wing.An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota. Hestayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to thedrums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’swork with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back toLake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on theday that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. Thetransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionairefound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate himfrom his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness andsent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgidjournalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitableshores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny inLittle Girl Bay.To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. Isuppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people likedhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one ofthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick andextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth andbought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and ayachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and theBarbary Coast, Gatsby left too.He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained withCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and evenjailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunkmight soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies byreposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted fiveyears, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kayecame on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Codyinhospitably died.I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, floridman with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during onephase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savageviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due toCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gayparties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself heformed the habit of letting liquor alone.And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-fivethousand dollars. He didn’t get it. He never understood the legaldevice that was used against him, but what remained of the millionswent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriateeducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to thesubstantiality of a man.------------------------------------------------------------------------He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here withthe idea of exploding those first wild rumours about his antecedents,which weren’t even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a timeof confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything andnothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, whileGatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set ofmisconceptions away.It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For severalweeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was inNew York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myselfwith her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sundayafternoon. I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought TomBuchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the reallysurprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane anda pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.“I’m delighted to see you,” said Gatsby, standing on his porch. “I’mdelighted that you dropped in.”As though they cared!“Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar.” He walked around theroom quickly, ringing bells. “I’ll have something to drink for you injust a minute.”He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But hewould be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing ina vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wantednothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all,thanks … I’m sorry—“Did you have a nice ride?”“Very good roads around here.”“I suppose the automobiles—”“Yeah.”Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom, who hadaccepted the introduction as a stranger.“I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.”“Oh, yes,” said Tom, gruffly polite, but obviously not remembering.“So we did. I remember very well.”“About two weeks ago.”“That’s right. You were with Nick here.”“I know your wife,” continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.“That so?”Tom turned to me.“You live near here, Nick?”“Next door.”“That so?”Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation, but lounged backhaughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—untilunexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.“We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,” she suggested.“What do you say?”“Certainly; I’d be delighted to have you.”“Be ver’ nice,” said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. “Well—think oughtto be starting home.”“Please don’t hurry,” Gatsby urged them. He had control of himselfnow, and he wanted to see more of Tom. “Why don’t you—why don’t youstay for supper? I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people droppedin from New York.”“You come to supper with me,” said the lady enthusiastically. “Both ofyou.”This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.“Come along,” he said—but to her only.“I mean it,” she insisted. “I’d love to have you. Lots of room.”Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn’t seethat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t.“I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” I said.“Well, you come,” she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.“We won’t be late if we start now,” she insisted aloud.“I haven’t got a horse,” said Gatsby. “I used to ride in the army, butI’ve never bought a horse. I’ll have to follow you in my car. Excuseme for just a minute.”The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the ladybegan an impassioned conversation aside.“My God, I believe the man’s coming,” said Tom. “Doesn’t he know shedoesn’t want him?”“She says she does want him.”“She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.” Hefrowned. “I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may beold-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days tosuit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mountedtheir horses.“Come on,” said Mr. Sloane to Tom, “we’re late. We’ve got to go.”  Andthen to me: “Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?”Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and theytrotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliagejust as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out thefront door.Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for onthe following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’sparty. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality ofoppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other partiesthat summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort ofpeople, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured,many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, apervading harshness that hadn’t been there before. Or perhaps I hadmerely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world completein itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second tonothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I waslooking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes. It is invariably saddeningto look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended yourown powers of adjustment.They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparklinghundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.“These things excite me so,” she whispered. “If you want to kiss meany time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be gladto arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card.I’m giving out green—”“Look around,” suggested Gatsby.“I’m looking around. I’m having a marvellous—”“You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.”Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinkingI don’t know a soul here.”“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcelyhuman orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree. Tomand Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompaniesthe recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.“She’s lovely,” said Daisy.“The man bending over her is her director.”He took them ceremoniously from group to group:“Mrs. Buchanan … and Mr. Buchanan—” After an instant’s hesitation headded: “the polo player.”“Oh no,” objected Tom quickly, “not me.”But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained “thepolo player” for the rest of the evening.“I’ve never met so many celebrities,” Daisy exclaimed. “I liked thatman—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.”Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.“Well, I liked him anyhow.”“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly,“I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful,conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before. Then theysauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour,while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden. “In casethere’s a fire or a flood,” she explained, “or any act of God.”Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to suppertogether. “Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?” hesaid. “A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.”“Go ahead,” answered Daisy genially, “and if you want to take down anyaddresses here’s my little gold pencil.” … She looked around after amoment and told me the girl was “common but pretty,” and I knew thatexcept for the half-hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’thaving a good time.We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault—Gatsby hadbeen called to the phone, and I’d enjoyed these same people only twoweeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the airnow.“How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?”The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against myshoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.“Wha’?”A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golfwith her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:“Oh, she’s all right now. When she’s had five or six cocktails shealways starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave italone.”“I do leave it alone,” affirmed the accused hollowly.“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebodythat needs your help, Doc.’ ”“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, withoutgratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head inthe pool.”“Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,” mumbled MissBaedeker. “They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet.“Speak for yourself!” cried Miss Baedeker violently. “Your handshakes. I wouldn’t let you operate on me!”It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing withDaisy and watching the moving-picture director and his Star. They werestill under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching exceptfor a pale, thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that hehad been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain thisproximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimatedegree and kiss at her cheek.“I like her,” said Daisy, “I think she’s lovely.”But the rest offended her—and inarguably because it wasn’t a gesturebut an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented“place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishingvillage—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the oldeuphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitantsalong a shortcut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful inthe very simplicity she failed to understand.I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feetof light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadowmoved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow,an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in aninvisible glass.“Who is this Gatsby anyhow?” demanded Tom suddenly. “Some bigbootlegger?”“Where’d you hear that?” I inquired.“I didn’t hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people arejust big bootleggers, you know.”“Not Gatsby,” I said shortly.He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched underhis feet.“Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerietogether.”A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar.“At least they are more interesting than the people we know,” she saidwith an effort.“You didn’t look so interested.”“Well, I was.”Tom laughed and turned to me.“Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her undera cold shower?”Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper,bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before andwould never have again. When the melody rose her voice broke upsweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each changetipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.“Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,” she saidsuddenly. “That girl hadn’t been invited. They simply force their wayin and he’s too polite to object.”“I’d like to know who he is and what he does,” insisted Tom. “And Ithink I’ll make a point of finding out.”“I can tell you right now,” she answered. “He owned some drugstores, alot of drugstores. He built them up himself.”The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.“Good night, Nick,” said Daisy.Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where“Three O’Clock in the Morning,” a neat, sad little waltz of that year,was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness ofGatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent fromher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be callingher back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rareand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who withone fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, wouldblot out those five years of unwavering devotion.I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party hadrun up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lightswere extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down thesteps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,and his eyes were bright and tired.“She didn’t like it,” he said immediately.“Of course she did.”“She didn’t like it,” he insisted. “She didn’t have a good time.”He was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.“I feel far away from her,” he said. “It’s hard to make herunderstand.”“You mean about the dance?”“The dance?” He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap ofhis fingers. “Old sport, the dance is unimportant.”He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom andsay: “I never loved you.” After she had obliterated four years withthat sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to betaken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go backto Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were fiveyears ago.“And she doesn’t understand,” he said. “She used to be able tounderstand. We’d sit for hours—”He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruitrinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.“I wouldn’t ask too much of her,” I ventured. “You can’t repeat thepast.”“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course youcan!”He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in theshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.“I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,” he said,nodding determinedly. “She’ll see.”He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted torecover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone intoloving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then,but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over itall slowly, he could find out what that thing was …… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down thestreet when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place wherethere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. Theystopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool nightwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changesof the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into thedarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of thecorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks reallyformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he couldclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on thepap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. Heknew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterablevisions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again likethe mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to thetuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. Athis lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and theincarnation was complete.Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I wasreminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrasetried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s,as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startledair. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered wasuncommunicable forever.                                 VIIIt was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lightsin his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely asit had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over. Only gradually did Ibecome aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into hisdrive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wonderingif he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with avillainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.“Is Mr. Gatsby sick?”“Nope.” After a pause he added “sir” in a dilatory, grudging way.“I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr.Carraway came over.”“Who?” he demanded rudely.“Carraway.”“Carraway. All right, I’ll tell him.”Abruptly he slammed the door.My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in hishouse a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who neverwent into West Egg village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but orderedmoderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported thatthe kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in thevillage was that the new people weren’t servants at all.Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.“Going away?” I inquired.“No, old sport.”“I hear you fired all your servants.”“I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip. Daisy comes over quiteoften—in the afternoons.”So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at thedisapproval in her eyes.“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They’re allbrothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel.”“I see.”He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at herhouse tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisyherself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I wascoming. Something was up. And yet I couldn’t believe that they wouldchoose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowingscene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, ofthe summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, onlythe hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmeringhush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge ofcombustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while intoher white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under herfingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Herpocketbook slapped to the floor.“Oh, my!” she gasped.I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding itat arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate thatI had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,suspected me just the same.“Hot!” said the conductor to familiar faces. “Some weather! … Hot! …Hot! … Hot! … Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it … ?”My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!… Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carryingthe sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited atthe door.“The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece. “I’msorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch thisnoon!”What he really said was: “Yes … Yes … I’ll see.”He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, totake our stiff straw hats.“Madame expects you in the salon!” he cried, needlessly indicating thedirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to thecommon store of life.The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy andJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing downtheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.“We can’t move,” they said together.Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a momentin mine.“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the halltelephone.Gatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around withfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, excitinglaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.“The rumour is,” whispered Jordan, “that that’s Tom’s girl on thetelephone.”We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Verywell, then, I won’t sell you the car at all … I’m under no obligationsto you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, Iwon’t stand that at all!”“Holding down the receiver,” said Daisy cynically.“No, he’s not,” I assured her. “It’s a bona-fide deal. I happen toknow about it.”Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with histhick body, and hurried into the room.“Mr. Gatsby!” He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealeddislike. “I’m glad to see you, sir … Nick …”“Make us a cold drink,” cried Daisy.As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby andpulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.“You know I love you,” she murmured.“You forget there’s a lady present,” said Jordan.Daisy looked around doubtfully.“You kiss Nick too.”“What a low, vulgar girl!”“I don’t care!” cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch justas a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.“Bles-sed pre-cious,” she crooned, holding out her arms. “Come to yourown mother that loves you.”The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room androoted shyly into her mother’s dress.“The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowyhair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.”Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don’t think hehad ever really believed in its existence before.“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child, turning eagerly toDaisy.“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bentinto the single wrinkle of the small white neck. “You dream, you. Youabsolute little dream.”“Yes,” admitted the child calmly. “Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dresstoo.”“How do you like mother’s friends?” Daisy turned her around so thatshe faced Gatsby. “Do you think they’re pretty?”“Where’s Daddy?”“She doesn’t look like her father,” explained Daisy. “She looks likeme. She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and heldout her hand.“Come, Pammy.”“Goodbye, sweetheart!”With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held toher nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.Gatsby took up his drink.“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension.We drank in long, greedy swallows.“I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,” said Tomgenially. “It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall intothe sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s gettingcolder every year.“Come outside,” he suggested to Gatsby, “I’d like you to have a lookat the place.”I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant inthe heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointedacross the bay.“I’m right across from you.”“So you are.”Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedyrefuse of the dog-days alongshore. Slowly the white wings of the boatmoved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scallopedocean and the abounding blessed isles.“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding. “I’d like to be out therewith him for about an hour.”We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, anddrank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.“What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon?” cried Daisy, “and theday after that, and the next thirty years?”“Don’t be morbid,” Jordan said. “Life starts all over again when itgets crisp in the fall.”“But it’s so hot,” insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, “andeverything’s so confused. Let’s all go to town!”Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, mouldingits senselessness into forms.“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying toGatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of agarage.”“Who wants to go to town?” demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby’s eyesfloated toward her. “Ah,” she cried, “you look so cool.”Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone inspace. With an effort she glanced down at the table.“You always look so cool,” she repeated.She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He wasastounded. His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, andthen back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knewa long time ago.“You resemble the advertisement of the man,” she went on innocently.“You know the advertisement of the man—”“All right,” broke in Tom quickly, “I’m perfectly willing to go totown. Come on—we’re all going to town.”He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No onemoved.“Come on!” His temper cracked a little. “What’s the matter, anyhow?If we’re going to town, let’s start.”His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lipsthe last of his glass of ale. Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and outon to the blazing gravel drive.“Are we just going to go?” she objected. “Like this? Aren’t we goingto let anyone smoke a cigarette first?”“Everybody smoked all through lunch.”“Oh, let’s have fun,” she begged him. “It’s too hot to fuss.”He didn’t answer.“Have it your own way,” she said. “Come on, Jordan.”They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood thereshuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moonhovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changedhis mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.“Have you got your stables here?” asked Gatsby with an effort.“About a quarter of a mile down the road.”“Oh.”A pause.“I don’t see the idea of going to town,” broke out Tom savagely.“Women get these notions in their heads—”“Shall we take anything to drink?” called Daisy from an upper window.“I’ll get some whisky,” answered Tom. He went inside.Gatsby turned to me rigidly:“I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.”“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked. “It’s full of—” Ihesitated.“Her voice is full of money,” he said suddenly.That was it. I’d never understood before. It was full of money—thatwas the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle ofit, the cymbals’ song of it … High in a white palace the king’sdaughter, the golden girl …Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followedby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth andcarrying light capes over their arms.“Shall we all go in my car?” suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, greenleather of the seat. “I ought to have left it in the shade.”“Is it standard shift?” demanded Tom.“Yes.”“Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.”The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.“I don’t think there’s much gas,” he objected.“Plenty of gas,” said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. “Andif it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at adrugstore nowadays.”A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tomfrowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliarand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described inwords, passed over Gatsby’s face.“Come on, Daisy,” said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’scar. “I’ll take you in this circus wagon.”He opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.“You take Nick and Jordan. We’ll follow you in the coupé.”She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordanand Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby’s car, Tom pushed theunfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressiveheat, leaving them out of sight behind.“Did you see that?” demanded Tom.“See what?”He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have knownall along.“You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?” he suggested. “Perhaps I am,but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what todo. Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—”He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him backfrom the edge of theoretical abyss.“I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,” he continued. “Icould have gone deeper if I’d known—”“Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?” inquired Jordan humorously.“What?” Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. “A medium?”“About Gatsby.”“About Gatsby! No, I haven’t. I said I’d been making a smallinvestigation of his past.”“And you found he was an Oxford man,” said Jordan helpfully.“An Oxford man!” He was incredulous. “Like hell he is! He wears a pinksuit.”“Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.”“Oxford, New Mexico,” snorted Tom contemptuously, “or something likethat.”“Listen, Tom. If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?”demanded Jordan crossly.“Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knowswhere!”We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it wedrove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s fadedeyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s cautionabout gasoline.“We’ve got enough to get us to town,” said Tom.“But there’s a garage right here,” objected Jordan. “I don’t want toget stalled in this baking heat.”Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dustystop under Wilson’s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged fromthe interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.“Let’s have some gas!” cried Tom roughly. “What do you think westopped for—to admire the view?”“I’m sick,” said Wilson without moving. “Been sick all day.”“What’s the matter?”“I’m all run down.”“Well, shall I help myself?” Tom demanded. “You sounded well enough onthe phone.”With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight hisface was green.“I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,” he said. “But I need moneypretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with yourold car.”“How do you like this one?” inquired Tom. “I bought it last week.”“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.“Like to buy it?”“Big chance,” Wilson smiled faintly. “No, but I could make some moneyon the other.”“What do you want money for, all of a sudden?”“I’ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to goWest.”“Your wife does,” exclaimed Tom, startled.“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a momentagainst the pump, shading his eyes. “And now she’s going whether shewants to or not. I’m going to get her away.”The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of awaving hand.“What do I owe you?” demanded Tom harshly.“I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,” remarkedWilson. “That’s why I want to get away. That’s why I been botheringyou about the car.”“What do I owe you?”“Dollar twenty.”The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had abad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’talighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of lifeapart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physicallysick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a paralleldiscovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that therewas no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound asthe difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick thathe looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poorgirl with child.“I’ll let you have that car,” said Tom. “I’ll send it over tomorrowafternoon.”That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glareof afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned ofsomething behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.Eckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, thatother eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less thantwenty feet away.In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been movedaside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. Soengrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, andone emotion after another crept into her face like objects into aslowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—itwas an expression I had often seen on women’s faces, but on MyrtleWilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realizedthat her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but onJordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.------------------------------------------------------------------------There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as wedrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and hismistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slippingprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on theaccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leavingWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles anhour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came insight of the easygoing blue coupé.“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggestedJordan. “I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away.There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts offunny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, butbefore he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisysignalled us to draw up alongside.“Where are we going?” she cried.“How about the movies?”“It’s so hot,” she complained. “You go. We’ll ride around and meet youafter.” With an effort her wit rose faintly. “We’ll meet you on somecorner. I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gaveout a cursing whistle behind us. “You follow me to the south side ofCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.”Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and ifthe traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. Ithink he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of hislife forever.But they didn’t. And we all took the less explicable step of engagingthe parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us intothat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, inthe course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake aroundmy legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire fivebathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as“a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that itwas a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk andthought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already fouro’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubberyfrom the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,fixing her hair.“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyonelaughed.“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.“There aren’t any more.”“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently.“You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on thetable.“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby. “You’re the onethat wanted to come to town.”There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from itsnail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuseme”—but this time no one laughed.“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” inan interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.“What is?”“All this ‘old sport’ business. Where’d you pick that up?”“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “ifyou’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into soundand we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’sWedding March from the ballroom below.“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.“Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?”“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.“A man named Biloxi. ‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s afact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we livedjust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddytold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.”  Aftera moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, “Therewasn’t any connection.”“I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,” I remarked.“That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before heleft. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheerfloated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of“Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.“We’re getting old,” said Daisy. “If we were young we’d rise anddance.”“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her. “Where’d you know him, Tom?”“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort. “I didn’t know him. He was afriend of Daisy’s.”“He was not,” she denied. “I’d never seen him before. He came down inthe private car.”“Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. AsaBird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had roomfor him.”Jordan smiled.“He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president ofyour class at Yale.”Tom and I looked at each other blankly.“Biloxi?”“First place, we didn’t have any president—”Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”“Not exactly.”“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”“Yes—I went there.”A pause. Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and icebut the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closingof the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That’s why Ican’t really call myself an Oxford man.”Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were alllooking at Gatsby.“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after thearmistice,” he continued. “We could go to any of the universities inEngland or France.”I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of thoserenewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep.Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint!”“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one morequestion.”“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to theother. “You’re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.”“Self-control!” repeated Tom incredulously. “I suppose the latestthing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to yourwife. Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays peoplebegin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and nextthey’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage betweenblack and white.”Flushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing aloneon the last barrier of civilization.“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan.“I know I’m not very popular. I don’t give big parties. I supposeyou’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have anyfriends—in the modern world.”Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever heopened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was socomplete.“I’ve got something to tell you, old sport—” began Gatsby. But Daisyguessed at his intention.“Please don’t!” she interrupted helplessly. “Please let’s all gohome. Why don’t we all go home?”“That’s a good idea,” I got up. “Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.”“I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.”“Your wife doesn’t love you,” said Gatsby. “She’s never loved you.She loves me.”“You must be crazy!” exclaimed Tom automatically.Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.“She never loved you, do you hear?” he cried. “She only married youbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was aterrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!”At this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insistedwith competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them hadanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariouslyof their emotions.“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternalnote. “What’s been going on? I want to hear all about it.”“I told you what’s been going on,” said Gatsby. “Going on for fiveyears—and you didn’t know.”Tom turned to Daisy sharply.“You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?”“Not seeing,” said Gatsby. “No, we couldn’t meet. But both of us lovedeach other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know. I used tolaugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think thatyou didn’t know.”“Oh—that’s all.” Tom tapped his thick fingers together like aclergyman and leaned back in his chair.“You’re crazy!” he exploded. “I can’t speak about what happened fiveyears ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if Isee how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceriesto the back door. But all the rest of that’s a God damned lie. Daisyloved me when she married me and she loves me now.”“No,” said Gatsby, shaking his head.“She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolishideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He noddedsagely. “And what’s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go offon a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and inmy heart I love her all the time.”“You’re revolting,” said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Doyou know why we left Chicago? I’m surprised that they didn’t treat youto the story of that little spree.”Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.“Daisy, that’s all over now,” he said earnestly. “It doesn’t matterany more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’sall wiped out forever.”She looked at him blindly. “Why—how could I love him—possibly?”“You never loved him.”She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,as though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though shehad never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was donenow. It was too late.“I never loved him,” she said, with perceptible reluctance.“Not at Kapiolani?” demanded Tom suddenly.“No.”From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords weredrifting up on hot waves of air.“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep yourshoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone … “Daisy?”“Please don’t.” Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.She looked at Gatsby. “There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she triedto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigaretteand the burning match on the carpet.“Oh, you want too much!” she cried to Gatsby. “I love you now—isn’tthat enough? I can’t help what’s past.” She began to sobhelplessly. “I did love him once—but I loved you too.”Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed.“You loved me too?” he repeated.“Even that’s a lie,” said Tom savagely. “She didn’t know you werealive. Why—there’s things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know,things that neither of us can ever forget.”The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.“I want to speak to Daisy alone,” he insisted. “She’s all excitednow—”“Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,” she admitted in a pitifulvoice. “It wouldn’t be true.”“Of course it wouldn’t,” agreed Tom.She turned to her husband.“As if it mattered to you,” she said.“Of course it matters. I’m going to take better care of you from nowon.”“You don’t understand,” said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. “You’renot going to take care of her any more.”“I’m not?” Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford tocontrol himself now. “Why’s that?”“Daisy’s leaving you.”“Nonsense.”“I am, though,” she said with a visible effort.“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.“Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring heput on her finger.”“I won’t stand this!” cried Daisy. “Oh, please let’s get out.”“Who are you, anyhow?” broke out Tom. “You’re one of that bunch thathangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I’vemade a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry itfurther tomorrow.”“You can suit yourself about that, old sport,” said Gatsby steadily.“I found out what your ‘drugstores’ were.” He turned to us and spokerapidly. “He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-streetdrugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over thecounter. That’s one of his little stunts. I picked him for abootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn’t far wrong.”“What about it?” said Gatsby politely. “I guess your friend WalterChase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.”“And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you? You let him go to jail fora month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on thesubject of you.”“He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, oldsport.”“Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!” cried Tom. Gatsby saidnothing. “Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, butWolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.”That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face.“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly,“but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell meabout.”I glanced at Daisy, who was staring terrified between Gatsby and herhusband, and at Jordan, who had begun to balance an invisible butabsorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back toGatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is saidin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had“killed a man.” For a moment the set of his face could be described injust that fantastic way.It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denyingeverything, defending his name against accusations that had not beenmade. But with every word she was drawing further and further intoherself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as theafternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice acrossthe room.The voice begged again to go.“Please, Tom! I can’t stand this any more.”Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courageshe had had, were definitely gone.“You two start on home, Daisy,” said Tom. “In Mr. Gatsby’s car.”She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimousscorn.“Go on. He won’t annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuouslittle flirtation is over.”They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental,isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle ofwhisky in the towel.“Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?”I didn’t answer.“Nick?” He asked again.“What?”“Want any?”“No … I just remembered that today’s my birthday.”I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of anew decade.It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and startedfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, buthis voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour onthe sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathyhas its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic argumentsfade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade ofloneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinningbriefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan besideme, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgottendreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan facefell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke ofthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.------------------------------------------------------------------------The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside theash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had sleptthrough the heat until after five, when he strolled over to thegarage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, paleas his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to goto bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business ifhe did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violentracket broke out overhead.“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.“She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’regoing to move away.”Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, andWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, hesat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the carsthat passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariablylaughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife’s man and nothis own.So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilsonwouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspiciousglances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certaintimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, someworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelistook the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But hedidn’t. He supposed he forgot to, that’s all. When he came outsideagain, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversationbecause he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs inthe garage.“Beat me!” he heard her cry. “Throw me down and beat me, you dirtylittle coward!”A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands andshouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came outof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and thendisappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure ofits colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. Theother car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yardsbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her lifeviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick darkblood with the dust.Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn openher shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her leftbreast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listenfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little atthe corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up thetremendous vitality she had stored so long.------------------------------------------------------------------------We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were stillsome distance away.“Wreck!” said Tom. “That’s good. Wilson’ll have a little business atlast.”He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, aswe came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garagedoor made him automatically put on the brakes.“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantlyfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walkedtoward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” utteredover and over in a gasping moan.“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly.He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into thegarage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metalbasket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with aviolent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his waythrough.The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; itwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivalsderanged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.Myrtle Wilson’s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in anotherblanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay ona worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bendingover it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman takingdown names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first Icouldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoedclamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on theraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding tothe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a lowvoice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on hisshoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowlyfrom the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerkback to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,horrible call:“Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!”Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring aroundthe garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark tothe policeman.“M-a-v—” the policeman was saying, “—o—”“No, r—” corrected the man, “M-a-v-r-o—”“Listen to me!” muttered Tom fiercely.“r—” said the policeman, “o—”“g—”“g—” He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.“What you want, fella?”“What happened?—that’s what I want to know.”“Auto hit her. Ins’antly killed.”“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.“She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.“One goin’ each way. Well, she”—his hand rose toward the blankets butstopped halfway and fell to his side—“she ran out there an’ the onecomin’ from N’York knock right into her, goin’ thirty or forty milesan hour.”“What’s the name of this place here?” demanded the officer.“Hasn’t got any name.”A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car. New.”“See the accident?” asked the policeman.“No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty. Goingfifty, sixty.”“Come here and let’s have your name. Look out now. I want to get hisname.”Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying inthe office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among hisgrasping cries:“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kindof car it was!”Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tightenunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing infront of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothinggruffness.Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and thenwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little. “I just got here a minuteago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talkingabout. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do youhear? I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but thepoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculenteyes.“What’s all that?” he demanded.“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm onWilson’s body. “He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellowcar.”Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.“And what colour’s your car?”“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, andthe policeman turned away.“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, sethim down in a chair, and came back.“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snappedauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glancedat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut thedoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding thetable. As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, wepushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came downhard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while Iheard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing downhis face.“The God damned coward!” he whimpered. “He didn’t even stop his car.”------------------------------------------------------------------------The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the darkrustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at thesecond floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.“Daisy’s home,” he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me andfrowned slightly.“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There’s nothing we cando tonight.”A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed ofthe situation in a few brisk phrases.“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waitingyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you somesupper—if you want any.” He opened the door. “Come in.”“No, thanks. But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi. I’ll waitoutside.”Jordan put her hand on my arm.“Won’t you come in, Nick?”“No, thanks.”I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordanlingered for a moment more.“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day,and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something ofthis in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up theporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my headin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’svoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away fromthe house, intending to wait by the gate.I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby steppedfrom between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weirdby that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosityof his pink suit under the moon.“What are you doing?” I inquired.“Just standing here, old sport.”Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he wasgoing to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised tosee sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him inthe dark shrubbery.“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.“Yes.”He hesitated.“Was she killed?”“Yes.”“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It’s better that the shockshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.”He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.“I got to West Egg by a side road,” he went on, “and left the car inmy garage. I don’t think anybody saw us, but of course I can’t besure.”I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary totell him he was wrong.“Who was the woman?” he inquired.“Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil didit happen?”“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly Iguessed at the truth.“Was Daisy driving?”“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was. You see,when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it wouldsteady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we werepassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, butit seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we weresomebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman towardthe other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The secondmy hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed herinstantly.”“It ripped her open—”“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced. “Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. Itried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergencybrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently. “I’m just going towait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantnessthis afternoon. She’s locked herself into her room, and if he triesany brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”“He won’t touch her,” I said. “He’s not thinking about her.”“I don’t trust him, old sport.”“How long are you going to wait?”“All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisyhad been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he mightthink anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three brightwindows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the groundfloor.“You wait here,” I said. “I’ll see if there’s any sign of acommotion.”I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravelsoftly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtainswere open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch wherewe had dined that June night three months before, I came to a smallrectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blindwas drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles ofale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in hisearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in awhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or theale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable airof natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have saidthat they were conspiring together.As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along thedark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him inthe drive.“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated. “You’d better come home and getsome sleep.”He shook his head.“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.”He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to hisscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness ofthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in themoonlight—watching over nothing.                                 VIIII couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on theSound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage,frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive,and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that Ihad something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morningwould be too late.Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he wasleaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.“Nothing happened,” he said wanly. “I waited, and about four o’clockshe came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turnedout the light.”His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night whenwe hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed asidecurtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet ofdark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort ofsplash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicableamount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though theyhadn’t been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliartable, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the Frenchwindows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.“You ought to go away,” I said. “It’s pretty certain they’ll traceyour car.”“Go away now, old sport?”“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”He wouldn’t consider it. He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until heknew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope andI couldn’t bear to shake him free.It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth withDan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glassagainst Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was playedout. I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, withoutreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known. In various unrevealedcapacities he had come in contact with such people, but always withindiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitinglydesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers fromCamp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such abeautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathlessintensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to heras his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than otherbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through itscorridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away alreadyin lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’sshining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcelywithered. It excited him, too, that many men had already lovedDaisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence allabout the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of stillvibrant emotions.But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossalaccident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he wasat present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment theinvisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So hemade the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously andunscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, tookher because he had no real right to touch her hand.He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her underfalse pretences. I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantommillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; helet her believe that he was a person from much the same strata asherself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter offact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standingbehind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal governmentto be blown anywhere about the world.But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he hadimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—butnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of agrail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realizejust how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be. She vanished into herrich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing. He feltmarried to her, that was all.When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless,who was, somehow, betrayed. Her porch was bright with the boughtluxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably asshe turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. Shehad caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charmingthan ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth andmystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of manyclothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above thehot struggles of the poor.------------------------------------------------------------------------“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her,old sport. I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but shedidn’t, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lotbecause I knew different things from her … Well, there I was, way offmy ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a suddenI didn’t care. What was the use of doing great things if I could havea better time telling her what I was going to do?”On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in hisarms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day, with fire in theroom and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed hisarm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoonhad made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memoryfor the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closerin their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one withanother, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulderor when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she wereasleep.------------------------------------------------------------------------He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before hewent to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got hismajority and the command of the divisional machine-guns. After thearmistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication ormisunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now—therewas a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters. She didn’t seewhy he couldn’t come. She was feeling the pressure of the worldoutside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside herand be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchidsand pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm ofthe year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in newtunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the“Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silverslippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there werealways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever,while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by thesad horns around the floor.Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with theseason; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day withhalf a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads andchiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floorbeside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for adecision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decisionmust be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionablepracticality—that was close at hand.That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of TomBuchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and hisposition, and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certainstruggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he wasstill at Oxford.------------------------------------------------------------------------It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest ofthe windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning,gold-turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dewand ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was aslow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool,lovely day.“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a windowand looked at me challengingly. “You must remember, old sport, she wasvery excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way thatfrightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheapsharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”He sat down gloomily.“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they werefirst married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in hisconception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on theirwedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey toLouisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week,walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together throughthe November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to whichthey had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy’s house had alwaysseemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his ideaof the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervadedwith a melancholy beauty.He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have foundher—that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach—he was pennilessnow—was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on afolding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliarbuildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellowtrolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once haveseen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as itsank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishingcity where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his handdesperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment ofthe spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by toofast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that partof it, the freshest and the best, forever.It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on theporch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and therewas an autumn flavour in the air. The gardener, the last one ofGatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves’ll startfalling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”“Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.“You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”I looked at my watch and stood up.“Twelve minutes to my train.”I didn’t want to go to the city. I wasn’t worth a decent stroke ofwork, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby. Imissed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.“Do, old sport.”“I’ll call you about noon.”We walked slowly down the steps.“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if hehoped I’d corroborate this.“I suppose so.”“Well, goodbye.”We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge Iremembered something and turned around.“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth thewhole damn bunch put together.”I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I evergave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First henodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant andunderstanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that factall the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot ofcolour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when Ifirst came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn anddrive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at hiscorruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing hisincorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him forthat—I and the others.“Goodbye,” I called. “I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”------------------------------------------------------------------------Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on aninterminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweatbreaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called meup at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements betweenhotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any otherway. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool,as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at theoffice window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said. “I’m at Hempstead, and I’m goingdown to Southampton this afternoon.”Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the actannoyed me, and her next remark made me rigid.“You weren’t so nice to me last night.”“How could it have mattered then?”Silence for a moment. Then:“However—I want to see you.”“I want to see you, too.”“Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town thisafternoon?”“No—I don’t think this afternoon.”“Very well.”“It’s impossible this afternoon. Various—”We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talkingany longer. I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but Iknow I didn’t care. I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-tablethat day if I never talked to her again in this world.I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. Itried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire wasbeing kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out mytimetable, I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then Ileaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.------------------------------------------------------------------------When I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crosseddeliberately to the other side of the car. I supposed there’d be acurious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for darkspots in the dust, and some garrulous man telling over and over whathad happened, until it became less and less real even to him and hecould tell it no longer, and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement wasforgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened atthe garage after we left there the night before.They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must havebroken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived shewas stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance hadalready gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this, sheimmediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of theaffair. Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her inthe wake of her sister’s body.Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the frontof the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth onthe couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open, andeveryone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door. Michaelisand several other men were with him; first, four or five men, latertwo or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last strangerto wait there fifteen minutes longer, while he went back to his ownplace and made a pot of coffee. After that, he stayed there alone withWilson until dawn.About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent mutteringchanged—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. Heannounced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow carbelonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago hiswife had come from the city with her face bruised and her noseswollen.But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry “Oh,my God!” again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attemptto distract him.“How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sitstill a minute, and answer my question. How long have you beenmarried?”“Twelve years.”“Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still—I asked you aquestion. Did you ever have any children?”The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, andwhenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside itsounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench wasstained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortablyaround the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and fromtime to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.“Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if youhaven’t been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the churchand get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”“Don’t belong to any.”“You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You musthave gone to church once. Didn’t you get married in a church? Listen,George, listen to me. Didn’t you get married in a church?”“That was a long time ago.”The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a momenthe was silent. Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look cameback into his faded eyes.“Look in the drawer there,” he said, pointing at the desk.“Which drawer?”“That drawer—that one.”Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in itbut a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braidedsilver. It was apparently new.“This?” he inquired, holding it up.Wilson stared and nodded.“I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it, but Iknew it was something funny.”“You mean your wife bought it?”“She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.”Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozenreasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash. But conceivablyWilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle,because he began saying “Oh, my God!” again in a whisper—his comforterleft several explanations in the air.“Then he killed her,” said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.“Who did?”“I have a way of finding out.”“You’re morbid, George,” said his friend. “This has been a strain toyou and you don’t know what you’re saying. You’d better try and sitquiet till morning.”“He murdered her.”“It was an accident, George.”Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widenedslightly with the ghost of a superior “Hm!”“I know,” he said definitely. “I’m one of these trusting fellas and Idon’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I knowit. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and hewouldn’t stop.”Michaelis had seen this too, but it hadn’t occurred to him that therewas any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson hadbeen running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop anyparticular car.“How could she of been like that?”“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question.“Ah-h-h—”He began to rock again, and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in hishand.“Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?”This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend:there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little laterwhen he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window,and realized that dawn wasn’t far off. About five o’clock it was blueenough outside to snap off the light.Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ash-heaps, where small greyclouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in thefaint dawn wind.“I spoke to her,” he muttered, after a long silence. “I told her shemight fool me but she couldn’t fool God. I took her to thewindow”—with an effort he got up and walked to the rear window andleaned with his face pressed against it—“and I said ‘God knows whatyou’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing. You may fool me, butyou can’t fool God!’ ”Standing behind him, Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking atthe eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, pale andenormous, from the dissolving night.“God sees everything,” repeated Wilson.“That’s an advertisement,” Michaelis assured him. Something made himturn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilsonstood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, noddinginto the twilight.------------------------------------------------------------------------By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of acar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night beforewho had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, whichhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, andMichaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later andhurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced toPort Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich thathe didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired andwalking slowly, for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon. Thus farthere was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys whohad seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he staredoddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappearedfrom view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that timegoing from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. Onthe other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, andperhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted toknow. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone theway to Gatsby’s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.------------------------------------------------------------------------At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with thebutler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at thepool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that hadamused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him topump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to betaken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because thefront right fender needed repair.Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once hestopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if heneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared amongthe yellowing trees.No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleepand waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyoneto give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’tbelieve it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that wastrue he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid ahigh price for living too long with a single dream. He must havelooked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shiveredas he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlightwas upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material withoutbeing real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, driftedfortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding towardhim through the amorphous trees.The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard theshots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anythingmuch about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s houseand my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing thatalarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely aword said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurrieddown to the pool.There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as thefresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the ladenmattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind thatscarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidentalcourse with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leavesrevolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin redcircle in the water.It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardenersaw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust wascomplete.                                  IXAfter two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night andthe next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers andnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door. A rope stretchedacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, butlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, andthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about thepool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used theexpression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, andthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaperreports next morning.Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest broughtto light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole talewould shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who mighthave said anything, didn’t say a word. She showed a surprising amountof character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyesunder that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had neverseen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convincedherself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the verysuggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to aman “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in itssimplest form. And it rested there.But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myselfon Gatsby’s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of thecatastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and everypractical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised andconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe orspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, becauseno one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intensepersonal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called herinstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone awayearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.“Left no address?”“No.”“Say when they’d be back?”“No.”“Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?”“I don’t know. Can’t say.”I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room wherehe lay and reassure him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don’tworry. Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—”Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book. The butler gave mehis office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by thetime I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered thephone.“Will you ring again?”“I’ve rung three times.”“It’s very important.”“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that theywere chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filledit. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby withshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me. You’ve gotto try hard. I can’t go through this alone.”Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and goingupstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’dnever told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there wasnothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,staring down from the wall.Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,which asked for information and urged him to come out on the nexttrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was surehe’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be awire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiemarrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers andnewspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I beganto have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsbyand me against them all. Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.                               Yours truly                             Meyer Wolfshiemand then hasty addenda beneath: Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all.When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago wascalling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection camethrough as a man’s voice, very thin and far away.“This is Slagle speaking …”“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”“There haven’t been any wires.”“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said rapidly. “They picked him up whenhe handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from NewYork giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before. What d’you knowabout that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns—”“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look here—this isn’t Mr.Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s dead.”There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by anexclamation … then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.------------------------------------------------------------------------I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatzarrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender wasleaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed,bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. Hiseyes leaked continuously with excitement, and when I took the bag andumbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparsegrey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was onthe point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made himsit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, andthe glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he said. “It was all in theChicago newspaper. I started right away.”“I didn’t know how to reach you.”His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.“It was a madman,” he said. “He must have been mad.”“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged him.“I don’t want anything. I’m all right now, Mr.—”“Carraway.”“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?”I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left himthere. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking intothe hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantlyaway.After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouthajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated andunpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has thequality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for thefirst time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the greatrooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to bemixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while hetook off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had beendeferred until he came.“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—”“Gatz is my name.”“—Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body West.”He shook his head.“Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position inthe East. Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?”“We were close friends.”“He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man,but he had a lot of brain power here.”He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great man. A man like James J.Hill. He’d of helped build up the country.”“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from thebed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep.That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded toknow who I was before he would give his name.“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is Klipspringer.”I was relieved too, for that seemed to promise another friend atGatsby’s grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw asightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself. Theywere hard to find.“The funeral’s tomorrow,” I said. “Three o’clock, here at the house.I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.”“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of course I’m not likely to seeanybody, but if I do.”His tone made me suspicious.“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called up about is—”“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How about saying you’ll come?”“Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying withsome people up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect me to be withthem tomorrow. In fact, there’s a sort of picnic or something. Ofcourse I’ll do my best to get away.”I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and he must have heard me, for hewent on nervously:“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder ifit’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see,they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort of helpless without them. Myaddress is care of B. F.—”I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because I hung up the receiver.After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom Itelephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that wasmy fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly atGatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I should have knownbetter than to call him.The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see MeyerWolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way. The door that Ipushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked “TheSwastika Holding Company,” and at first there didn’t seem to be anyoneinside. But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, anargument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewessappeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostileeyes.“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.”The first part of this was obviously untrue, for someone had begun towhistle “The Rosary,” tunelessly, inside.“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.”“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?”At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!”from the other side of the door.“Leave your name on the desk,” she said quickly. “I’ll give it to himwhen he gets back.”“But I know he’s there.”She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly upand down her hips.“You young men think you can force your way in here any time,” shescolded. “We’re getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s in Chicago,he’s in Chicago.”I mentioned Gatsby.“Oh-h!” She looked at me over again. “Will you just—What was yourname?”She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in thedoorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarkingin a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offeredme a cigar.“My memory goes back to when first I met him,” he said. “A young majorjust out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because hecouldn’t buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when hecame into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for ajob. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days. ‘Come on have somelunch with me,’ I said. He ate more than four dollars’ worth of foodin half an hour.”“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.“Start him! I made him.”“Oh.”“I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw rightaway he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he toldme he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to jointhe American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he didsome work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick likethat in everything”—he held up two bulbous fingers—“always together.”I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Seriestransaction in 1919.“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment. “You were his closest friend,so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.”“I’d like to come.”“Well, come then.”The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his headhis eyes filled with tears.“I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,” he said.“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s all over now.”“When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in anyway. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different—if a friendof mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You maythink that’s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.”I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,so I stood up.“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a “gonnegtion,” but heonly nodded and shook my hand.“Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive andnot after he is dead,” he suggested. “After that my own rule is to leteverything alone.”When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to WestEgg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and foundMr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in hisson and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now hehad something to show me.“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took out his wallet with tremblingfingers. “Look there.”It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirtywith many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. “Lookthere!” and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it sooften that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very pretty picture. It shows upwell.”“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”“He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live innow. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I seenow there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front ofhim. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.”He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for anotherminute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet andpulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called HopalongCassidy.“Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just showsyou.”He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. Onthe last flyleaf was printed the word schedule, and the date September12, 1906. And underneath:    Rise from bed                                  6:00      a.m.    Dumbell exercise and wall-scaling              6:15-6:30 ”    Study electricity, etc.                        7:15-8:15 ”    Work                                           8:30-4:30 p.m.    Baseball and sports                            4:30-5:00 ”    Practise elocution, poise and how to attain it 5:00-6:00 ”    Study needed inventions                        7:00-9:00 ”               General Resolves  * No wasting time at Shafters or [a name, indecipherable]  * No more smokeing or chewing.  * Bath every other day  * Read one improving book or magazine per week  * Save $5.00 [crossed out] $3.00 per week  * Be better to parents“I came across this book by accident,” said the old man. “It justshows you, don’t it?”“It just shows you.”“Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like thisor something. Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind? Hewas always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once, and I beathim for it.”He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and thenlooking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down thelist for my own use.A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, andI began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So didGatsby’s father. And as the time passed and the servants came in andstood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously, and hespoke of the rain in a worried, uncertain way. The minister glancedseveral times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to waitfor half an hour. But it wasn’t any use. Nobody came.------------------------------------------------------------------------About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemeteryand stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse,horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in thelimousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postmanfrom West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin. As westarted through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and thenthe sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. Ilooked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had foundmarvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three monthsbefore.I’d never seen him since then. I don’t know how he knew about thefuneral, or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses, andhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolledfrom Gatsby’s grave.I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was alreadytoo far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, thatDaisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur“Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyedman said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoketo me by the gate.“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.“Neither could anybody else.”“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they used to go there by thehundreds.”He took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.------------------------------------------------------------------------One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep schooland later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther thanChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of aDecember evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up intotheir own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I rememberthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That’s and thechatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caughtsight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: “Are yougoing to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?” and the longgreen tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murkyyellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad lookingcheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, andthe dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wildbrace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as wewalked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably awareof our identity with this country for one strange hour, before wemelted indistinguishably into it again.That’s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swedetowns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the streetlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of hollywreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, alittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacentfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings arestill called through decades by a family’s name. I see now that thishas been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy andJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed somedeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly awareof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond theOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only thechildren and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality ofdistortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantasticdreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, atonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhangingsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dresssuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies adrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles overthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at ahouse—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman’s name, and no onecares.After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distortedbeyond my eyes’ power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittleleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on theline I decided to come back home.There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasantthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted toleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferentsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over andaround what had happened to us together, and what had happenedafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a bigchair.She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked likea good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair thecolour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as thefingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me withoutcomment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, thoughthere were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but Ipretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’tmaking a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got upto say goodbye.“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly. “You threwme over on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about you now, but itwas a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”We shook hands.“Oh, and do you remember”—she added—“a conversation we had once aboutdriving a car?”“Why—not exactly.”“You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless of meto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.”“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five years too old to lie to myself andcall it honour.”She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendouslysorry, I turned away.------------------------------------------------------------------------One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking aheadof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out alittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head movingsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just asI slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning intothe windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back,holding out his hand.“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”“Yes. You know what I think of you.”“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don’t knowwhat’s the matter with you.”“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right aboutthose missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step afterme and grabbed my arm.“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we weregetting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t inhe tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me ifI hadn’t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in hispocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly.“What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threwdust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he was a toughone. He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never evenstopped his car.”There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that itwasn’t true.“And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, whenI went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuitssitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. ByGod it was awful—”I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had donewas, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless andconfused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed upthings and creatures and then retreated back into their money or theirvast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and letother people clean up the mess they had made …I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly asthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellerystore to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuffbuttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.------------------------------------------------------------------------Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn hadgrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village nevertook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute andpointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over toEast Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a storyabout it all his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him whenI got off the train.I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could stillhear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear amaterial car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But Ididn’t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been awayat the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house oncemore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with apiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to thebeach and sprawled out on the sand.Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly anylights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across theSound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began tomelt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here thatflowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the newworld. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby’shouse, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of allhuman dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held hisbreath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aestheticcontemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for thelast time in history with something commensurate to his capacity forwonder.And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought ofGatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end ofDaisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dreammust have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. Hedid not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in thatvast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republicrolled on under the night.Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year byyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s nomatter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … Andone fine morning—So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly intothe past.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data = torch.tensor(encode(text), dtype =
